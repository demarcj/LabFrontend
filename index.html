          I am a student studying Java at Grand Circus. I’m an ambitious problem
          solver with a passion for software development. Before I’d started
          studying programming, I was studying special effects and motion
          graphics. I decided to pursue a career as a software developer because
          on the most technical level there can be programming or coding. I’d
          began learning coding for different Adobe software and decided to take
          try coding full time. I am interested in finding a company that is calm
          and comfortable.
